      <p>2023-08-07: Website Created</p>
      <p>I'm launching this website as a place for 
         my work in photgraphy. It's important for me to 
         set goals in relation to my hobbies and creating a website
         will help me fulfill some of those goals. It will do this by 
         giving me a space to reflect on my work and, more importantly, 
         think about how I want my work to be viewed.</p>

      <p>2023-11-18: New Beginnings</p>
      <p>I've begun revamping this website and I'm adding more things (like this blog!). The site has been
         dormant for some months, but I'm feeling motivated and I'm trying new layouts and appearances. Hopefully 
         it looks more professional now. As for the blog, I plan on updating it at least monthly. It's likely
         that no one will read it, but it will be nice to look back on.

      <p>2023-12-23: New Toys</p>
      <p>Good news! I'm finally shooting with a "real" camera again, and I'm loving it. I picked up an Oly EM10-ii 
         and it makes my photography process incredibly easy. I've paired this camera with a 28 mm f2.8 and a 50mm f1.4, which are 56 and 100mm 
         on full frame, respectively. Going back to what I said earlier, the live zoom, focus peaking, and flip up screen have really helped 
         me compose my shots better and I think that demonstrates itself in my photography. For example, I've taken a lot more shots that I'm happy 
         with recently. I will be uploading those to the <a href="photos.html">gallery</a> soon! Thanks for reading.
