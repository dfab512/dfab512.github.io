      <p>2023-08-07: website created</p>
      <p>i'm launching this website as a place for 
         my work in photgraphy. it's important for me to 
         set goals in relation to my hobbies and creating a website
         will help me fulfill some of those goals. it will do this by 
         giving me a space to reflect on my work and, more importantly, 
         think about how i want my work to be viewed.

      <p>2023-11-18: new beginnings</p>
      <p>i've begun revamping this website and i'm adding more things (like this blog!). the site has been
         dormant for some months, but i'm feeling motivated and i'm trying new layouts and appearances. hopefully 
         it looks more professional now. as for the blog, i plan on updating it at least monthly. it's likely
         that no one will read it, but it will be nice to look back on. 
      </p>

      <p>2023-12-23: new toys</p>
      <p>good news! i'm finally shooting with a "real" camera again, and i'm loving it. i picked up an oly em10-ii 
         and it makes my photography process incredibly easy. i've paired this camera with a 28 mm f2.8 and a 50mm f1.4, which are 56 and 100mm 
         on full frame, respectively. going back to what i said earlier, the live zoom, focus peaking, and flip up screen have really helped 
         me compose my shots better and i think that demonstrates itself in my photography. for example, i've taken a lot more shots that i'm happy 
         with recently. i will be uploading those to the <a class="link" href="photos.html">gallery</a> soon! thanks for reading.

      <p>2024-07-03: a better blog</p>
      <p>a day early?? insane. not a lot has changed but one crucial thing! i finally got a wide angle lens for my om-d em10ii, the m.zuiko 17mm f2.8, made by olympus themselves. you can go see what it looks 
         like on the <a class="link" href="cameras.html">gear page</a>! i think it looks amazing on the body of the camera (almost like it was meant to be there 
         or something). once again though, micro four thirds surprised me with how tiny it can get. i can truly call my camera a pocketable one now and it is so 
         light. it was a huge weight off my shoulders, to say the least. in all honesty, its performance suprised me for how old it is, as well as considering that it was one of the 
         first lenses that came out for the mft mount. the only minor drawback is autofocusing with video, it can be hunt a lot and be loud, but i don't really shoot video and if i were to, i 
         would use manual focus anyways, the camera offers focus peaking which aids with this too. overall it is a fantastic lens and i'm really happy with what i got for the price (around $100 usd). 
         recently, i've posted lots of pictures that i took with this lens on my <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/dfab512/">instagram</a>. check them out if you'd like! jaanu i

      <p>2024-08-13: from the start</p>
      <p>i missed the one year anniversary this website but i'm here 6 days later to celebrate! i'll be starting college not too long from now, and i'm pretty excited! i'm really
         looking forward to meeting new people and sharing my own interests. i hope i find lots of people interested in the same things i'm interested in, and i hope my interest 
         in those things grow because of this. specifically, i'm most interested in meeting other photographers, though i'm not too sure how easy it'll be to do so since the
         photography club's instagram page has been inactive since the covid years. either way, i'm looking forward to this year in my life, and i have a person to stick by through all of it, thanks for being in 
         my life (you know who you are <3) 
      </p>

      <p>2024-09-28: domain and domain</p>
      <p>hey everyone! i just got a new domain name: fabian.exposed! in hindsight it sounds like a naughty site but whatever, that makes it cooler right? it's cool because i 
         do photography and stuff and in order to take a photo you must expose it first and stuff yeah yeah anyways..
