      <p>2023-08-07: Website Created</p>
      <p>I'm launching this website as a place for 
         my work in photgraphy. It's important for me to 
         set goals in relation to my hobbies and creating a website
         will help me fulfill some of those goals. It will do this by 
         giving me a space to reflect on my work and, more importantly, 
         think about how I want my work to be viewed.</p>

      <p>2023-11-18: New Beginnings</p>
      <p>I've begun revamping this website and I'm adding more things (like this blog!). The site has been
         dormant for some months, but I'm feeling motivated and I'm trying new layouts and appearances. Hopefully 
         it looks more professional now. As for the blog, I plan on updating it at least monthly. It's likely
         that no one will read it, but it will be nice to look back on.
